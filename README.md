# callManagementApi
In this project, I have created api end points for the call management system.

**API END POINTS **

"/saveCall" --> to save the call to the database
"/getHighestCallsDay" --> to get the day of the week on which calls are very high.
"/getLongestCallsDay" --> to get the day of the week on which the calls are long.
"/getHighestCallsHour" --> to get the hour of the day on which the calls are high.
"/getLongestCallsHour" --> to get the hour of the day on which the calls are long.
